## [Project 1: SUBE personal data scraper and cleaner](https://github.com/Gabeeh94/SUBE-Project)

A Python scraper that downloads the PDF with all the SUBE's (Buenos Aires's public transportation system) data of a particular person and a script that uses OCR to create a csv from the images. This file is then intended to be used to do some basic analysis and visualizations.



## [Project 2: Regression based on the Economic Freedom Index](https://github.com/Gabeeh94/Economic-Freedom-Regression)

¿Is there a relationship between GDP per capita and the economic freedom score of a country?

To answer this question, different regressions taking as a dependent variable (that is, the one we want to explain) the GDP per capita adjuste by purchase parity power and as an independent variable the economic freedom score of the Heritage foundation. For this analysis we used Python and the modules numpy, Pandas, statsmodel and matplotlib.

Final Model:

y = 20,0134x² - 950,0644x

## [Project 3: Suicide Rate Analysis using SQL and Python](https://github.com/Gabeeh94/Suicide-Rate)
